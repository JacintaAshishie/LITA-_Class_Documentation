This project focuses on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to extract valuable insights from various data sources. 
The primary goal is to provide actionable recommendations based on data-driving findings.

### Data Sources
```
The Primary data source of data used here is Text cleaning data .xlsx

### Tools Used

  1. For data cleaning
  2. Analysis
  3. Visualization
- SQL - Structure Query Language for quering of data
- Github for portfolio building
-  Power BI  for Data Visualization


### Data Cleaning and Preparations
```
In the initial stage of the data cleaning and preparations we used the following Excel Functions to clean our data;
  1. UPPER
  2. TRIM
  3. LOWER
  4. PROPER
  5. RANDBETWEEN

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  ```
  LAP involves the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
  - what is the overall sales trend?
  - what is the total sales per product?
  - what is the total sales by region?
  - what are the top selling products?

    ### Data Analysis
```
    This is where we include some basic lines of codes or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis;
    ```SQL
    SELECT *FROM[dbo].[CAPSTONE SALESDATA]
    WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
